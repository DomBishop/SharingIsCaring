# What is HTTP?

Short for **HyperText Transfer Protocol**, it's part of the **TCP/IP** protocol used on the **World Wide Web** and 
it defines how messages are formatted and transmitted in addition to what web servers and browsers do in response to different
commands. It was it was initialy created to transfer HTML documents, but eventualy grew to support any other data. It also works on a client/server model, is stateless and responds server status codes to the client.

### In short, it's how we interact over the internet
